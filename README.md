# About

Optrax is a personal project I’ve been developing to sharpen my skills with .NET 8 and Azure. It’s a full-featured platform designed for growers to manage and monitor their operations from seed to sale.

Users can create and organize farms or growing sites, add crops, and track plantings through every stage.

The app includes inventory and resource tracking, plant genetics management, detailed reporting, and a real-time analytics dashboard. It also uses Leaflet.js for interactive mapping and a fully responsive UI.

<sup>**_Please Note: This project is very much a work in progress, with new features being actively developed and refined. Expect ongoing improvements as the platform evolves_**</sup>
